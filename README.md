# Tokenmaxxing — every AI coding subscription, one glance

Claude, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Grok, Kimi, Z.ai… all your AI usage in your task
bar. No dashboards, no tab-digging, no mental math.

> **The Windows + Linux build of [OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage).**
> OpenUsage is a macOS menu-bar app by [Robin Ebers](https://github.com/robinebers) — and it only runs on macOS.
> Tokenmaxxing is the community port that brings it to **Windows and Linux**. Not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenUsage; all original design and credit go to its authors — see [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

> ### 🔥 This is the unhinged fork
>
> *“Token death is a social construct. We maxx anyway.”*
>
> This build adds a **satirical "Unhinged Mode"** on top of the rock-solid tracker:
> dramatic pace labels, a **Token Oracle** that roasts you, and a **Doom Clock**
> counting down to quota death. **It's a joke wrapped around a real tool** — the
> tracking underneath is accurate and untouched. Don't want the bit? Toggle
> **Dramatic Mode off** in Settings (sane mode) and it's the plain tracker again.
> Full design notes in [UNHINGED_SPEC.md](UNHINGED_SPEC.md).

## Platform status

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Windows** | ✅ NSIS installer, auto-updates. Beta — feedback welcome. |
| **Linux** | ✅ deb / rpm / AppImage, auto-updates. |
| **macOS** | Use **[OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage)** — it's native there and this fork doesn't ship a macOS build. |

The panel is a borderless, always-on-top window driven by a global shortcut. (On macOS, OpenUsage uses a native `NSPanel`; that code is kept but unshipped — port notes in [PORTING.md](PORTING.md).)

## Download

**[⬇ Latest release](https://github.com/falkoro/tokenmaxxing/releases/latest)** — pick your platform:

- **Windows**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_x64-setup.exe` (SmartScreen warns — unsigned; *More info → Run anyway*)
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_amd64.deb`
- **Fedora/openSUSE**: `Tokenmaxxing-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`
- **Any Linux**: `Tokenmaxxing_<version>_amd64.AppImage` (`chmod +x`, then run)

It **auto-updates**: checks GitHub releases every 15 minutes and updates in place. Fresh per-commit builds are also published as [Build Desktop artifacts](../../actions/workflows/build-desktop.yml) (requires GitHub login).

## What it does

Tokenmaxxing lives in your task bar and shows how much of each AI subscription you've burned — progress bars, plan badges, and pace indicators that warn you *before* you run dry.

- **One glance.** Every AI tool, one panel.
- **Pace-aware.** Green/amber/red dots flag when you're on track to run out early.
- **Always fresh.** Refreshes on a schedule you pick.
- **Global shortcut.** Toggle the panel from anywhere.
- **Plugin-based.** New providers ship without app updates.
- **[Local HTTP API](docs/local-http-api.md).** Read your usage from `127.0.0.1:6736`.
- **[Proxy support](docs/proxy.md).** Route provider requests through SOCKS5 / HTTP.
- **[Remote dashboard](remote/README.md).** Serve your usage to other machines.

### Unhinged Mode (toggleable)

On by default in this fork; flip it off in **Settings → Unhinged Mode** for plain
sane tracking.

- **Seethe Level + Rank.** A 0–100 aggregate of all your providers, with an
  unhinged rank ladder (*Promptlet* → *Token Deity*).
- **Dramatic pace labels.** *Still coping* → *Getting mogged* → *TOKEN DEATH IMMINENT*.
- **Token Oracle.** Curated copium/roasts, weighted by how cooked you are.
- **Doom Clock.** Live countdown to the wall on your most-constrained provider.
- **Cope Intensity slider.** Decide how unhinged the messaging gets (0 = touch grass).
- **Demo mode.** A slider that scrubs the whole unhinged UI through every state.

Every string is catalogued in [UNHINGED_STRINGS.md](UNHINGED_STRINGS.md).
